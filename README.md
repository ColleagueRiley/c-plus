# C-Plus
C-Plus is an middle ground between c and c++. 

It attemps to merge the cleanness low-levelness, and over all efficiency of c with higher level abstraction.

Although C-Plus supports objects [via structures with functions] it does not support OOP directly and does not plan to ever support OOP directly.
